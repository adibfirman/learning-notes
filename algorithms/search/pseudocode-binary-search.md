- search(arr, low, high)
- due to of we find a middle of the value use this formula
  - mid = lo + (high-low)/2
- there are several condition that we need to meet
  - if val = mid
  - else if val > mid
    - low = mid + 1
  - else high = mid
- this psudocode with assumption that we have a sorted array
