- Basically with this technique we not looking for the value like a linear one
- Instead, we just some kind of the devided technique lets say like logaritma use case

32
16
8
4
2
1

if the 32 is called like an array [0...32] then if technically want to find a value we need to look it back of the half of the n(32) which is 16.

- until we find the last of the value in above case we have a value 32 then the last of the value is 1 we will stop to scanning anything that to be devided
